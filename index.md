Welcome to The IdolFest Foundation
==============

The IdolFest Foundation is bringing Japanese idol culture to North America.

Our purpose is to create educational gatherings that highlight Japanese idol culture and music. We bring our community together to learn and share our passion for idols; providing a venue for performers, panelists, and industry guests to share their knowledge.

We put on annual events to bring together individuals where we highlight important Japanese cultural traditions and share them with new audiences.

We currently produces [NW IdolFest](https://nwidolfest.com), located in Seattle, WA; and [SC IdolFest](https://scidolfest.com), located in Torrance, CA.
